Database corruption issues should now be a thing of the past:
  Database integrity is checked after each save
  Data is written to the filesystem using a transactional model (meaning: if an error occurs, the original file is left untouched)
  Auto-save on suspend/exit is now only active when database has changes and its size is under 1MB
Added the ability to move entries and groups
Allows restoring and deleting from entry history
Updated KeePass lib to version 2.44
